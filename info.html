            <div class="text-margin">To exercise control upon the user, the designer should understand the pragmatic discourses and theories of UX & UI. Not only the pragmatical parts but the
                criticisms, the different
                methodologies and interface studies. As much as one wants to manifest itself as an individual that seeks to create a positive and empowering digital space for the user, it is the
                architect, out of pragmatisms, that holds the ruling. Many principles, in theory, argue how the user should come first (and be in control). Yet, interfaces created have become the
                source of drive in the user's behaviour, affecting the performance of their digital self or digital expression.</div>
            <div class="text-margin">
                The user has become the consumer. The consumer has become the user. - A most paradoxical happening, or rather a mirror. The user-consumer has become mirrored on the interface, and the
                interface has become a mirror on the user-consumer.</div>
            <div class="text-margin">
                This digital space is a digital archive, holding an on-going collection of digital manifestos.
                <a class="link-video" href="https://youtu.be/C31XYgr8gp0?t=120">"In the current, digitized world, trivial information is, accumulating, every second, preserved in all its triteness.
                    Never fading, always
                    accessible. All this junk data preserved in
                    an unfiltered state."</a>
                In this space, exists no user individuality, only a self-view mirror through the webcam. The interface no longer serves to coerce the user's performance and digital-self.
